      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, Thanks for stopping by. I am currently enroled in the coding bootcamp at DU.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've moved around alot as a kid, but most recently I lived in Las Vegas, NV for five years working as a Spanish teacher before moving to Colorado in June 2020.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Listening to music, metal, classic rock, experimental electronica, hip hop, and more. If I have any spare time, I'm probably playing guitar, coding, playing Japanese mah-jong, or, of course, spending time with my family</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a facination with space. I would enjoy eventually working as a programmer for a company that creates satilites, or studies the universe.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm currently in the Highlands Ranch / Littleton area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have a gift for languages, and coding, to me, is the perfect combination of logic and art. I started by playing pranks on my parents using applescript as a kid, and now, after leaving the mischeif behind, I'm interested in python and machine learning. It's never too late to start something new, and I'm excited to continue learning.</p>
